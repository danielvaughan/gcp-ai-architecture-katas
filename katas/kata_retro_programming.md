# Retro Programming

Rating: Hard

To support a surge of interest in retro programming, Usborne republish their classic programming books from the 80s that gave programming listings to type into 8-bit computers, specifically the mighty ZX Spectrum.

Nothing causes more frustration for readers than a programme that doesn't work, so they want to create an automated testing process to run on their Google Cloud infrastructure.

Given a picture of the original book, the system should extract the programming listing into a file and then run it on a spectrum emulator.

It should then publish a webpage with the following:
* The formatted code listing
* Screenshot from the running programme
* A button to launch the program in an emulator
* A description of the program
* Tags for the concepts used
* Explanation of the programming concepts being used
