# Fuel Tracker

I like to keep track of the fuel I use in my car but find filling out an app or spreadsheet fiddly.an

I want to take two photos, one of the petrol pump when finished and another of the dashboard of my car.an

From the photos, I then want to:

* Extract the amount, cost per litre and total cost of my fill-up
* The current mileage of my car

I then want to record that information in a spreadsheet, together with:
* Where I bought the fuel
* When I bought the fuel
* What type of fuel I bought

I then want to calculate:
* Miles per gallon
* Cost per mile
